;
; Here you configure all areas that CrashMail knows. Area definitions begin
; with AREA for echomail areas and NETMAIL for netmail areas. Local areas 
; defined with LOCALAREA are not used by CrashMail, but are included in
; config files created by CrashExport and are maintained when running
; CrashMaint.
;
; To see the supported messagebase formats in your version of CrashMail,
; type "crashmail version". What path should be used depends on the used
; messagebase formats.
;
; Netmail messages addressed to the Aka or to one of the nodes specified on
; an IMPORT line are imported in netmail areas. Echomail areas cannot have
; an IMPORT line but instead has one or more EXPORT lines where the nodes
; that this area should be sent to are listed. Each node on an export line
; has the format "[<modifier>]<node>" where modifier may be !, @ or %.
; ! means that the node is read-only, @ means that the node is write-only
; and % means that the node is the feed for this area.
;
; Note that nodes on the EXPORT line may be abbreviated. And example:
;
;    EXPORT 2:2/2 1 .5 3/2 .22 3 .33
; 
; will be expanded to
;
;    EXPORT 2:2/2 2:2/1 2:2/1.5 2:3/2 2:3/2.22 2:3/3 2:3/3.33
;
; Nodes in the BANNED line may not subscribe to this area with the AreaFix.
; MANDATORY means that nodes may not unsubscribe from this area in the
; AreaFix. DEFREADONLY means that nodes that subscribe to this area in the
; AreaFix will be added as read-only.
;
; Areas with UNCONFIRMED are areas that have been auto-added by CrashMail
; but not yet confirmed. Areas get this flag when the node didn't have the
; flag AUTOADD set. CrashMail treats unconfirmed areas as if they didn't
; exist at all.

; KEEPNUM and KEEPDAYS are used by CrashMaint to decide how long messages
; should be kept in the messagebase.
;
; An area with the tagname BAD is a special area that are used for messages
; that for some reason are considered "bad" by CrashMail.
;
; Another special kind of areas are the default areas. When CrashMail adds
; an area, it searches for a default area to use as a template. First it
; looks for an area named DEFAULT_<groups> where <groups> contains the group
; of the new area. If such an area doesn't exist, it looks for an area called
; DEFAULT. If a default area was found, CrashMail copies this configuration
; for this area to the new area. In the path of the default area, you can
; use the following %-codes:
;
; %a  Name of the area
; %l  Name of the area in lowercase letters
; %8  Eight digit serial number
;
; You must use one of these %-codes or the new path will not be unique.
